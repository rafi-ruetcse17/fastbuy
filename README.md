## ðŸš€ Running the Project with Docker

### **Prerequisites**
- Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Ensure Docker is running

### **Steps to Run the Project Using Docker**

1. **Create a ```.env``` file inside the ```server ```  directory and set two varibales**
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres_db:5432/demodb?schema=public
   JWT_SECRET=6cc98c44c5298080d11a0cae3
   ```
   you can also generate a jwt secret from: https://jwtsecret.com/generate

2. **Open terminal and navigate to the Project Directory**  
   ```bash
   cd fastbuy
   ```

3. **Build and Start the Containers**  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   - This command will:
     - Build the Docker images for both the **client** and **server**.
     - Start the containers.

4. **Access the Application**
   - **Backend (API Server):** `http://localhost:4000`
   - **Frontend (Client App):** `http://localhost:3000`

5. **Stopping the Containers**
   To stop the running containers, press `CTRL + C`, or run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Troubleshooting
If you face this prisma related issue (e.g. The table `public.User` does not exist in the current database) during sign up or login, open terminal and go to `server` directory. Then run the command below:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec server npx prisma migrate dev
   ```
make sure your docker container is running before you run this command.
